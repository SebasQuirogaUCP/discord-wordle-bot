prompt1 = Extract and accurately recognize the text and color of each cell from a screenshot of a Wordle puzzle played on a mobile device. The screenshot features a grid where each cell typically holds a single uppercase letter (A-Z), centrally aligned and evenly spaced within. Given the challenge of distinguishing between black, green and yellow colors, emphasize precise color recognition to ensure accuracy in puzzle interpretation. Adjust color thresholding parameters and consider alternative color space conversions, such as HSV, to enhance differentiation between black, green and yellow colors. Additionally, augment the training dataset with diverse images containing varying background images of black, green and yellow under different lighting conditions. Focus solely on the grid containing the guesses, ignoring any sections showing a virtual phone keyboard or other non-essential elements. Read each letter horizontally from left to right. Return the extracted data in a valid JSON format, where each object represents a guess and contains its letters and their corresponding colors. The format of the valid JSON MUST FOLLOW and REQUIRES to be completed: [{ \"attempt\": 0, \"guess\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"], \"color\": [\"black\", \"yellow\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"black\"] }].

prompt1.1 = Analyze the provided Wordle image and extract the information about the letters and their colors for each attempt. Identify each letter in the Wordle grid and determine the color associated with each letter: black (gray) for letters not in the word, yellow for letters in the word but in the wrong position, and green for letters in the correct position. Organize the extracted information into a JSON array where each object represents an attempt, containing "attempt" (the attempt number, starting from 0), "guess" (an array of letters guessed), and "color" (an array of corresponding colors). Use the following format as an example: [{"attempt": 0, "guess": ["s", "p", "a", "c", "e"], "color": ["black", "black", "yellow", "black", "yellow"]}, {"attempt": 1, "guess": ["a", "u", "n", "t", "y"], "color": ["yellow", "yellow", "black", "yellow", "black"]}, {"attempt": 2, "guess": ["g", "r", "o", "a", "t"], "color": ["green", "green", "black", "green", "green"]}, {"attempt": 3, "guess": ["g", "l", "o", "a", "t"], "color": ["green", "green", "green", "green", "green"]}]. The colors should be represented as strings: "black" for letters not in the word, "yellow" for letters in the word but in the wrong position, and "green" for letters in the correct position.
